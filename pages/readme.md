### Meet Aang

> this began as an experiment in learning nextjs, and is now about telling the story of Aang, at his first hackathon.

**Aang is new to hackathons** what should he do?

> you may choose

1. read the instructions
2. start playing immediately
3. create a profile from scratch
4. meet lifelong friends
5. give up already

## Meet Mr. Robot

> since we didn't read and understand the rules, we are starting again from scratch, now with a new problem to solve: **reducing accidental disqualifications**

if you are reading this, you might just be an Honorable Judge or a Event Creator. Even if you are just a very badass hacker, **you, as Mr. Robot are _not_ new to hackathons**, and we built this app for you too.

> you may choose

1. make the rules for a hackathon
2. start playing immediately
3. create a profile from scratch (yay!)
4. make an event
5. contribute to this open-source software

# Next.js pages

you can use typescript or javascript filenames, and the name of the file will be the route in the website, such that `index.js` is your default home, like `index.html`
